              Our Story
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-4">
              <p>
                TileVille began as a passion project inspired by classic
                strategy games and the emerging possibilities of blockchain
                technology. Our founder, having spent years in traditional game
                development, saw an opportunity to create something truly unique
                by combining engaging gameplay with the transparency and
                ownership that blockchain enables.
              </p>
              <p>
                In early 2023, the initial concept for TileVille was sketched
                out - a strategic tile-placement game where players could
                compete directly against each other, own digital assets with
                real utility, and participate in a growing economy. We chose the
                Mina blockchain for its efficiency, security, and growing
                ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
                After months of development and testing with our early
                community, TileVille officially launched in Q1 2024. Today, were
                continuing to expand the game with new features, competitions,
                and opportunities for players to earn rewards while having fun.
