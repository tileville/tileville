          <h2>4. User Content</h2>

          <p>
            Users may be able to create, post, or share content through our
            Service. By providing content, you grant us a non-exclusive,
            worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, publicly display,
            reproduce, and distribute such content on and through the Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            You are solely responsible for your content and the consequences of
            sharing it. Content that is offensive, illegal, or violates the
            rights of others is prohibited.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>

          <p>
            The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by
            users), features, and functionality are and will remain the
            exclusive property of TileVille and its licensors. The Service is
            protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws.
          </p>

          <h2>6. NFT Ownership</h2>

          <p>
            When you purchase a TileVille NFT, you own the NFT itself – a record
            on the blockchain that represents a digital item – but you do not
            own the underlying intellectual property rights to the content. Your
            purchase of an NFT grants you:
          </p>

          <ul>

              A personal, non-commercial license to display the NFT content
            </li>
            <li>The right to sell, trade, or transfer the NFT</li>
            <li>
              Any gameplay benefits or utility associated with the NFT within
              the TileVille platform
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

          <p>
            In no event shall TileVille, nor its directors, employees, partners,
            agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect,
            incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including
            without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other
            intangible losses, resulting from:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service
            </li>
            <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Service</li>
            <li>Any content obtained from the Service</li>

            We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately,
            without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever,
            including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive
            termination shall survive termination, including, without
            limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity,
            and limitations of liability.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>

          <p>
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of
            these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.
