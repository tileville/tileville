              Cities account for over 70% of global carbon emissions while
              occupying just 2% of the Earths land. How we design and operate
              our urban environments has a tremendous impact on our planets
              future.

            </p>
            <p>
              The concepts explored in TileVille are based on real-world
              sustainable urban development principles that architects, urban
