## Game Basics

TileVille is inspired by Six Sided Streets, where you strategically place hexagonal tiles to create roads, neighborhoods, and special buildings. Each placement affects your overall city development and score. The game combines planning, strategy, and a bit of luck.

- **View next tiles**: See the upcoming tiles in the queue
- **End game**: Submit your final city when you're satisfied or can't place more tiles

### Tile Types
- **Residential (Green)**: Creates neighborhoods when connected
- **Commercial (Blue)**: Generates value when placed near residential areas
- **Industrial (Yellow)**: Provides jobs but should be kept away from residential
- **Roads (Gray)**: Connect different city sections for better flow
- **Special Buildings (Purple)**: Unique structures with special bonuses

## Scoring System

Your final score depends on multiple factors:

### Base Points

### Penalties

## Advanced Strategies

### The "Ring Road" Strategy
Create a circular road structure around your central neighborhood for maximum connectivity.

### The "District" Approach
Develop specialized districts (residential, commercial, industrial) and connect them strategically.

### The "Rivers and Bridges" Technique
Use natural boundaries to separate incompatible zones while providing limited connectivity.
