The game board consists of a grid where you'll place various tiles. Each game starts with a few pre-placed tiles which serve as your starting point.

### Tile Types

TileVille features various types of tiles, each serving different purposes:

1. **Residential Tiles** (Houses) - Provide housing for your city's population.
2. **Commercial Tiles** (Shops) - Generate income for your city.
3. **Road Tiles** - Connect different parts of your city, enabling transportation.
4. **Park Tiles** - Improve the happiness of nearby residents.
5. **Windmill Tiles** - Generate power for your city's buildings.
6. **Water Tiles** - Essential resource tiles that support your city's needs.
7. **Farm Tiles** - Produce food for your city's population.

### Resource Management

Successful city planning requires balancing various resources:

- **Population**: Increases with residential tiles
- **Happiness**: Affected by parks, services, and city layout
- **Power**: Generated by windmills
- **Food**: Produced by farms
- **Money**: Generated by commercial activities

### Tile Placement Rules

- Tiles must be placed adjacent to existing tiles
- Some tiles have specific placement requirements (e.g., windmills need open space)
- Roads need to connect to existing road networks
- Residential areas benefit from proximity to parks and services
- Commercial tiles thrive near residential areas
