# Mina Blockchain & TileVille

TileVille is proudly built on the Mina Protocol, bringing the benefits of blockchain technology to casual gaming. This page explains how we use Mina's unique capabilities to enhance your gaming experience.

## What is Mina Protocol?

Mina is often called the "world's lightest blockchain" because it maintains a constant size of only about 22KB, regardless of how much transaction data it processes. This is achieved through advanced cryptography, specifically zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge).

### Key Features of Mina

- **Lightweight**: The entire blockchain stays around 22KB
- **Decentralized**: Anyone can verify the blockchain with minimal resources
- **Private**: zk-SNARKs enable privacy-preserving applications
- **Sustainable**: Low resource requirements mean lower energy consumption
- **Developer-friendly**: Typescript support and accessible tools
