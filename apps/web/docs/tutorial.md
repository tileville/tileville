# TileVille Game Tutorial

Welcome to TileVille! This guide will walk you through the basics of gameplay, strategies, and tips to help you become a master builder.

## Getting Started

### Game Objective
In TileVille, your goal is to strategically place hexagonal tiles to create an interconnected landscape with roads, cities, and terrain features. The player with the highest score at the end wins.

### Basic Controls
- **Select a Tile**: Click on a tile from your available tiles
- **Rotate Tile**: Right-click or use the rotation buttons
- **Place Tile**: Click on an empty space on the board
- **View Score**: Your current score is displayed at the top of the screen
- **Remaining Tiles**: Check how many tiles you have left at the bottom of the screen

## Tile Types and Scoring

TileVille features different types of tile edges and features that must be connected strategically:

### Road Segments
- Roads connect towns and cities
- Score points by creating complete routes (roads that connect to endpoints)
- Longer routes earn more points
- Dead ends (roads that don't connect) may reduce your score

### City Segments
- Cities appear as built-up areas on tile edges
- Connect matching city segments to create larger settlements
- Larger cities earn more points
- Incomplete cities earn fewer points

### Terrain Types
- Fields, forests, lakes, and mountains make up the landscape
- Connecting similar terrain creates larger natural areas
- Larger continuous terrain areas earn more points
- Some special combinations (like lakes beside mountains) can earn bonus points

### Special Features
- **Landmarks**: Some tiles contain special landmarks that provide bonus points
- **Crossroads**: Road intersections can create valuable connection points
- **Bridges**: Allow roads to cross water features without breaking connections

## Gameplay Phases

### 1. Planning Phase
- Assess your starting position
- Consider what types of connections will be most valuable
- Think several moves ahead

### 2. Building Phase
- Place tiles strategically to maximize connections
- Balance immediate points vs. long-term strategy
- Watch for opportunities to block opponents (in PvP mode)

### 3. End Game
- Plan your final moves carefully
- Focus on completing high-value features
- Place remaining tiles to minimize penalties

## Scoring System

Points are awarded for:

| Feature | Scoring Mechanism | Points |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Roads | Per complete route | 1 point per segment |
| Cities | Per completed city | 2 points per city segment |
| | Incomplete cities | 1 point per city segment |
| Terrain | Connected areas | 1 point per tile |
| | Special combinations | Bonus points vary |
| Landmarks | Special features | 3-10 points each |

## Advanced Strategies

### City Building
- Focus on completing small cities early for guaranteed points
- Only start large cities if you have enough tiles to complete them
- Place city segments at the edges of your layout for easier expansion

### Road Networks
- Create roads that connect multiple features for maximum efficiency
- Use crossroads to create multiple scoring opportunities
- Remember that incomplete roads score no points

### Terrain Management
- Create large continuous areas of the same terrain type
- Position high-value terrain next to matching edges
- Use terrain to separate competing features

### Defensive Play (PvP Only)
- Block opponents' expansion routes
- Create complex edge patterns that are difficult to match
- Save versatile tiles for late-game adjustments

## Speed Challenge Tips

For timed challenges, follow these additional strategies:

1. **Prioritize quick decisions** over perfect placements
2. **Focus on simple connections** rather than complex combinations
3. **Place tiles anywhere** if you're running out of time (points are better than no placement)
4. **Scan the board quickly** for obvious matching opportunities
5. **Save versatile tiles** for difficult situations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring edge compatibility** - All edges must match adjacent tiles
2. **Creating too many open connections** - Harder to complete features
3. **Saving special tiles too long** - Use powerful tiles when they can make the biggest impact
4. **Focusing only on one feature type** - Balance city building with road networks
5. **Poor planning for tile rotation** - Consider all possible orientations before placing

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| R | Rotate tile clockwise |
| E | Rotate tile counter-clockwise |
| Space | Skip current tile (if allowed) |
| Z | Undo last move (if allowed) |
| H | Show hint (if available) |

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: City Connection
Try to create a city with at least 6 connected segments.

### Exercise 2: Road Network
Build a road network connecting at least 4 endpoints.

### Exercise 3: Terrain Mastery
Create a continuous forest or lake spanning at least 8 tiles.

## Competition and PvP Guide

### Competition Strategy
- Check the competition rules and scoring modifiers
- Focus on high-value features if time is limited
- Consider risk vs. reward when starting large features
- Always complete your placement before time runs out

### PvP Challenge Tactics
- Adapt to the entry fee level (higher stakes = more conservative play)
- Study your opponent's past games if possible
- In speed challenges, balance speed with accuracy
- Save your best strategies for high-reward matches

## Troubleshooting

### If a tile won't place:
- Check that all edges match adjacent tiles
- Ensure you have selected a valid placement location
- Verify that the tile orientation is correct

### If the game seems stuck:
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page if necessary
- Ensure your wallet is still connected
