## Strategy Corner

### Winning Technique: The "Neighborhood Clusters" Approach
Shared by our top players, this strategy focuses on creating 3-5 house neighborhoods that are self-contained and linked by commercial corridors:

1. Start with a residential focus in multiple locations
2. Create clear boundaries between neighborhoods
3. Use commercial buildings as "bridges" between residential areas
4. Place industrial zones at the periphery with road access

Average score improvement using this technique: 15-20%

### Community Tip: The "Sacrifice Tile" Method
Sometimes the best move is knowing when to "waste" a tile. Top players sometimes deliberately place a tile in a suboptimal position to set up a more valuable placement on the next turn.
