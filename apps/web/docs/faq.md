# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is TileVille?
TileVille is a strategic tile-placement game built on the Mina blockchain. Players build cities by strategically placing hexagonal tiles, competing for high scores in competitions, or challenging other players in PvP matches.

### Is TileVille free to play?
The practice mode is completely free. Competitions and PvP challenges typically require an entry fee paid in MINA tokens, which go toward the prize pool for winners.

### Which browsers are supported?
TileVille works best on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. For mobile play, we recommend using the Auro wallet browser for the best experience.

### Do I need a wallet to play?
Yes, you need a Mina blockchain wallet to play TileVille. We recommend using [Auro Wallet](https://www.aurowallet.com/), which is available as a browser extension and mobile app.

### How do I connect my wallet?
Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner of the screen and follow the prompts to connect your Auro Wallet.

## Gameplay

### How do I play TileVille?
The objective is to build the best possible city by strategically placing tiles. Each tile has different sides (roads, residential, commercial, etc.) that need to match with adjacent tiles. Check out our [Game Guide](/guide) for detailed instructions.

### What's the difference between Practice, Competitions, and PvP?
- **Practice**: Free play with no stakes, perfect for learning.
- **Competitions**: Time-limited events with entry fees and prize pools.
- **PvP**: Direct challenges against other players with winner-takes-all prizes.

### What are Speed Challenges?
Speed challenges add a time limit to complete your city. You must place all available tiles within the time limit (usually 3-5 minutes). This mode rewards quick thinking and efficiency.

### Can I save my progress in a game?
Games in progress in competitions and PvP challenges are automatically saved. You can return to them from your profile's "Active Games" section.

### What happens if I run out of time in a Speed Challenge?
Your city will be scored based on the tiles you managed to place before time ran out. Any unplaced tiles will count against your final score.

## Competitions & Rewards

### How do competitions work?
Competitions run for a set period (usually a few days to a week). Players pay an entry fee to join and play their best game. The highest scores on the leaderboard when the competition ends win prizes.

### How are competition prizes distributed?
Prize distribution varies by competition, but typically:
- 1st place: 50% of the prize pool
- 2nd place: 30% of the prize pool
- 3rd place: 15% of the prize pool
- 4th-10th place: Share the remaining 5%

### When do I receive my winnings?
Prizes are distributed automatically via smart contract within 24 hours after the competition ends and all scores are verified on the blockchain.

### What happens if there's a tie?
In case of a tie, the player who submitted their score first wins the higher position.

## PvP Challenges

### How do I create a PvP challenge?
Go to the PvP section, click "Create Challenge," set your parameters (entry fee, time limit, max participants), and share your challenge link.

### How does the prize pool work in PvP?
The prize pool equals the total entry fees from all participants minus a 1 MINA platform fee. The player with the highest score wins the entire prize pool.

### Can I join multiple challenges at once?
Yes, you can join as many challenges as you wish, provided you pay the entry fee for each.

### What happens if I create a challenge but no one joins?
If your challenge expires with no participants, any entry fee you paid will be refunded to your wallet minus transaction fees.

## NFTs & Digital Collection

### What are TileVille Builder NFTs?
TileVille Builder NFTs are unique digital assets that represent special buildings or features in the game. Some provide gameplay bonuses when used.

### How do I get NFTs?
You can:
- Win them in competitions
- Purchase them from our marketplace
- Trade with other players on platforms like minanft.io

### What makes TileVille NFTs special?
Each NFT has unique traits that affect its appearance and functionality in the game. Some are purely collectible, while others provide gameplay advantages.

### Do I need NFTs to play?

## Wallet & Transactions

### What blockchain does TileVille use?
TileVille is built on the Mina blockchain, known for its lightweight and efficient design.

### Why are my transactions pending?
Mina blockchain transactions typically confirm within 2-3 minutes. During periods of high network congestion, it may take longer.

### Is there a minimum MINA balance needed to play?
You'll need enough MINA to cover:
- Entry fees for competitions or challenges
- Transaction fees (typically very small on Mina)
- A small reserve for wallet functionality

We recommend having at least 1 MINA more than any entry fee you plan to pay.

### Why did my transaction fail?
Common reasons include:
- Insufficient balance
- Network congestion
- Wallet connection issues

You can check the status of your transaction on [MinaScan](https://minascan.io/).

## Account & Profile

### How do I change my username?
Go to your profile page and click "Edit Profile" to update your username and other information.

### Can I link my social media accounts?
Yes, you can connect your Twitter, Discord, and Telegram accounts in your profile settings. This makes it easier to find friends and receive notifications.

### What are followers and following?
You can follow other players to keep track of their achievements and challenge them more easily. When someone follows you, they'll see your updates in their feed.

### How do I recover my account if I lose access to my wallet?
Your TileVille account is tied to your blockchain wallet. If you lose access to your wallet, you'll need to use your wallet's recovery methods (usually a seed phrase).
