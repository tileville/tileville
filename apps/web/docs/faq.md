# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is TileVille?

TileVille is a strategic tile-placement game built on the Mina blockchain. Players arrange hexagonal tiles to create roads, cities, and landscapes while competing for high scores in competitions or challenging friends in PvP mode.

### Is TileVille free to play?

TileVille offers both free and paid gameplay options. You can play the demo game without any cost, but competitions and challenges may require entry fees paid in MINA tokens.

### What blockchain does TileVille use?

TileVille is built on the Mina Protocol, known for its lightweight blockchain technology that maintains a constant size regardless of transaction volume.

### How do I get started?

1. Connect your Mina wallet (Auro Wallet recommended)
2. Create a profile with your name and username
3. Try the demo game to learn the mechanics
4. Join a competition or challenge friends in PvP mode

## Wallet & Connection

### What wallet do I need to play TileVille?

We recommend using [Auro Wallet](https://www.aurowallet.com/), which is compatible with the Mina blockchain. Pallad wallet is currently not supported.

### Why can't I connect with Pallad wallet?

Currently, TileVille only supports Auro wallet. To use TileVille with Pallad:

1. Open Chrome extensions (`chrome://extensions`)
2. Disable Pallad Wallet temporarily
3. Install and use Auro Wallet

### How much MINA do I need to play?

This depends on the competition or challenge you want to join. Most competitions have entry fees ranging from 1-5 MINA. You'll also need a small amount (approximately 0.1 MINA) to cover transaction fees.

### What networks does TileVille support?

TileVille supports both Mina Mainnet and Berkeley Testnet. For competitions and NFT minting, Mainnet is required.

## Gameplay

### How do I play the game?

TileVille is inspired by Six Sided Streets:

1. Place hexagonal tiles to create roads, cities, and landscapes
2. Connect matching edges to score points
3. Plan your tile placement strategically to maximize your score
4. Complete the game by placing all available tiles

### What are the scoring rules?

Points are awarded for:

- Connecting road segments to create complete routes
- Building cities by connecting city segments
- Creating landscapes by grouping similar terrain types
- Completing special patterns or challenges
- Bonus points for efficient use of space

### What is a "Speed Challenge"?

Speed Challenges add a time constraint to the game. You must place all tiles within the specified time limit (typically 60-300 seconds). These challenges test both strategy and quick decision-making.

### Can I play on mobile?

While TileVille works on mobile browsers, we recommend playing on a desktop for the best experience. If using mobile, we recommend using the Auro wallet's built-in browser for a smoother experience.

## Competitions & PvP

### What's the difference between Competitions and PvP Challenges?

- **Competitions**: Organized events with fixed durations, entry fees, and prize pools. Players compete against all participants for the highest score.
- **PvP Challenges**: Player-created head-to-head challenges with customizable parameters like entry fees, time limits, and maximum participants.

### How do competition rewards work?

For official competitions, rewards are distributed to top performers based on the prize pool. The exact distribution depends on the competition rules, but typically:

- First place: 50-60% of the prize pool
- Second place: 25-30% of the prize pool
- Third place: 10-15% of the prize pool

### How do PvP challenge rewards work?

The winner of a PvP challenge receives the entire prize pool (total entry fees from all participants) minus a 1 MINA platform fee.

### How do I create a PvP challenge?

1. Navigate to the PvP section
2. Click "Create Challenge"
3. Set parameters (name, entry fee, end time, max participants)
4. Optional: Enable "Speed Challenge" and set time limit
5. Pay the 1 MINA creation fee
6. Share the invite link with friends
