# TileVille City Planning Tips & Strategies

## Fundamental Principles of City Planning

Creating a high-scoring, efficient city in TileVille requires careful planning and strategic thinking. This guide will help you master the art of city development from basic concepts to advanced techniques used by top-ranked players.

### The Core Elements of Success

#### 1. Resource Balance

The foundation of any successful TileVille city is maintaining proper balance between:

- **Population**: Residential buildings increase your population, which is necessary for growth but requires more resources.
- **Energy**: Windmills generate power to support your buildings.
- **Food**: Farms provide food for your citizens.
- **Water**: Water tiles support both residential and agricultural needs.
- **Happiness**: Parks and efficient layouts boost citizen satisfaction.

#### 2. Space Utilization

Every tile placement should be intentional:

- **Minimize wasted space**: Empty spaces between developments can lower your overall efficiency.
- **Plan for expansion**: Leave strategic gaps for future critical buildings.
- **Create compact neighborhoods**: Group similar buildings to maximize bonuses.

#### 3. Connectivity

Roads are more than just pathways:

- **Road hierarchy**: Create main arteries with smaller branch roads.
- **Minimize road tiles**: While necessary, excessive roads reduce usable space.
- **Connect all districts**: Ensure every part of your city is accessible.

## Starting Strong: Early Game Strategy

### First 10 Moves

1. **Assess your starting area**: Take note of pre-placed tiles and terrain features.
2. **Establish a basic road grid**: Create a simple pattern that allows for expansion.
3. **Build initial housing**: Place residential tiles near water sources if possible.
4. **Secure energy production**: Place windmills in positions that maximize output.
5. **Create small parks**: Early happiness bonuses compound over time.
6. **Start food production**: Place farms near water for higher yields.
7. **Add commercial spaces**: Place shops near residential areas.
8. **Connect all elements**: Ensure your road network links everything together.
9. **Create a small industrial zone**: Keep it away from residential areas for happiness.
10. **Place a community center**: Create a focal point for your developing city.

### Early Mistakes to Avoid

- **Expanding too quickly**: Focus on optimizing a smaller area before growing.
- **Neglecting power infrastructure**: Energy shortages severely limit growth.
- **Poor road planning**: Inefficient road networks are difficult to fix later.
- **Ignoring terrain advantages**: Water adjacency bonuses are critical for early farms.

## Mid-Game Development Strategies

### Creating Specialized Districts

#### Residential Zones

- **Mix housing densities**: Combine various residential tile types.
- **Green spaces**: Every residential block should have access to a park.
- **Service access**: Ensure commercial tiles are within easy reach.
- **Buffer zones**: Use parks to separate residential areas from industrial zones.

#### Commercial Districts

- **High traffic locations**: Place shops along main roads.
- **Clustering**: Group commercial buildings together for synergy bonuses.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure easy access from residential areas.
- **Mixed-use development**: Intersperse small parks to boost visitor happiness.

#### Industrial Sectors

- **Downwind placement**: Place industrial zones downwind from residential areas (typically east).
- **Infrastructure access**: Ensure strong road connections for resource movement.
- **Resource proximity**: Place near relevant resource tiles for production bonuses.
- **Expansion room**: Leave space for future industrial growth.

### Optimizing Resource Production

#### Energy Grid Planning

- **Wind mapping**: Place windmills in areas with maximum exposure (no adjacent tall buildings).
- **Redundancy**: Build slightly more capacity than you currently need.
- **Distribution**: Spread power sources throughout your city rather than concentrating them.
- **Power corridors**: Create dedicated paths for energy infrastructure.

#### Water Management

- **Reservoir creation**: Develop water collection points strategically.
- **Distribution network**: Ensure water access for both residential and agricultural zones.
- **Conservation areas**: Create protected water zones that boost adjacent tile production.
- **Flood mitigation**: Use terrain features to direct water flow and prevent flooding.

#### Agricultural Systems

- **Crop rotation**: Different farm types in adjacent tiles boost production.
- **Water adjacency**: Maximize the number of farm tiles with water access.
- **Agricultural belts**: Create dedicated farming zones on fertile land.
- **Distribution centers**: Place storage facilities near farm clusters for efficiency.

## Advanced Techniques for Expert Players

### City Patterns for Maximum Efficiency

#### The Grid System

```
R R R R R P
S S S R R P
R R R R R P
S S S R R P
R R R R R P
W W W W W W
```
R = Residential, S = Shop, P = Park, W = Water

This classic pattern optimizes residential happiness with parks while maintaining commercial access.

#### The Radial Pattern

```
    P
   RPR
  RPRPR
 RPRPRPR
RPRPRPRPR
 SSSSSSS
  SSSSS
   SSS
    S
```
R = Residential, P = Park, S = Shop

This circular design maximizes central accessibility while creating unified zones.

#### The Satellite System

```
   R R R      R R R
  R P P R    R P P R
 R P S P R  R P S P R
R P S S P RR P S S P R
R P S S P  P  P S S P R
 R P S P    R P S P R
  R P R      R P R
   R R        R R
```
R = Residential, P = Park, S = Shop

Multiple mini-communities connected by transport corridors maximize local efficiency while maintaining global connectivity.

### Specialized Builder Strategies

Different Builder NFTs excel with different city designs:

#### Eco-Balancer Builders

- Create evenly distributed resources
- Implement mixed-use developments
- Focus on sustainability over rapid expansion
- Utilize water features throughout the city

#### Agricultural Planner Builders

- Create extensive farming belts
- Optimize water adjacency for every farm
- Develop specialized crop clusters
- Implement efficient farm-to-market routes

#### Energy Grid Innovator Builders

- Design cities around power generation hubs
- Create redundant power networks
- Optimize windmill placement for maximum output
- Implement smart grid designs with minimal transmission loss

### Competition-Winning Secret Techniques

Top players consistently use these lesser-known strategies:

#### The 3-2-1 Rule

For every 3 residential tiles, include 2 commercial tiles and 1 park tile. This ratio has been mathematically proven to optimize happiness and economic output.

#### Happiness Path Tracing

Create continuous "happiness corridors" of parks that weave through residential areas, ensuring every home is adjacent to at least one park tile.

#### Edge Maximization

Place high-value buildings along the edges of your city map to reduce the number of adjacent requirements while maximizing available central space.

#### Resource Trinity Points

Create intersection points where water, energy, and road infrastructure meet, then build critical facilities at these "trinity points" for maximum efficiency bonuses.

## Adapting to Different Competition Formats

### Speed Challenge Strategies

In time-limited competitions:

1. **Pre-plan your first 15 moves** before starting
2. **Focus on core infrastructure** rather than aesthetic details
3. **Build in complete "blocks"** rather than scattered development
4. **Prioritize quick-win opportunities** like water adjacency bonuses

### Marathon Competition Approaches

For longer competitions:

1. **Create a master plan** with clear zoning
2. **Implement development phases** with specific goals
3. **Build flexible infrastructure** that allows for pivoting strategies
4. **Focus on long-term sustainability** rather than quick growth

## Learning From the Best

### Studying Leaderboard Cities

1. **Analyze top players' city layouts** by visiting their profiles
2. **Identify common patterns** among high-scoring cities
3. **Recognize resource allocation ratios** used by champions
4. **Adapt successful techniques** to your own playing style

### The Experimental Approach

Set aside time to:

1. **Test unconventional layouts** in practice mode
2. **Measure and compare results** from different approaches
3. **Develop personal "signature" strategies** that work for your style
4. **Document successful combinations** for future reference

## Conclusion

Remember that truly great cities in TileVille balance optimal efficiency with creative design. While following these guidelines will improve your scores, the most successful mayors also add their personal touch to create unique and beautiful urban landscapes.

Happy building, and may your city rise to the top of the leaderboards!
